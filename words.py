   Until you see how valuable your life is.
   ou tend to ignore things like this
   
   ...
   
   But now
   
   Ihave reached a state of acceotance and adaptability (bruh)
   
   and
   
   I have a goal.
   System: Please ener the gate
  
  
  
  
  {0} yeah yeah.

  39.
  
  39 Deaths.
  
  I have died to the soldier who livved inside the "gate " 39 times
  
  
  Do you know how much death actually pains.
  
  I would like to imagine its painless when you die of old age.
  
  But how about getting your limbs cut of by a giant fucking sword.
  
  Until you bleed out
  and die
  
  no one to hear your criesof help
  drowning in a pool of your own bloood
  
  
  
  
  Yet.
  
  I must keep trying.
  
  
  I must slay that knight.
  
  Because
  
  I fear
  
  Not dying to the knight
  
  But dying...
  
  of  a life filed wth regret....
